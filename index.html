    <p>We have misplaced a black school backpack containing a laptop, clothes, and both a student ID and Clipper card. The loss occurred on the night of November 3rd at Washington High School. The last online activity noted was on the morning of November 4th near the gym and tennis court at American High School. These items carry significant sentimental value to us.</p>
    <p>If you happen to find these items, we kindly ask you to get in touch with us by texting or calling (510) 255-5259. Please note, the MacBook laptop is remotely locked and can only be unlocked by Apple.</p>
    <p>Serial number of the macbook: <strong>FVHHVKJQQ6L4</strong>.</p>
    <p class="highlight">Willing to offer cash.</p>
